# TypeScript Service Models for ATShop 2.0
A collection of models for interacting with the ATShop API. Easily **c**reate, **r**ead, **u**pdate and **d**elete 
ATShop resources.

> **NOTICE** This is still very much a work in progress. The documentation for this package is mostly provided 
exclusively through TypeScript type hints.

## Installation & Setup
There's a couple steps to getting started with `atshop-service-models`.

### 1. Install
Just pull in the package through npm.
```bash
npm install atshop-service-models
```

### 2. Install dependencies.
Depending on where you're implementing these models, you'll also need to pull in and setup a 
[Feathers](https://feathersjs.com/) client.
```bash
npm install @feathersjs/feathers @feathersjs/socketio-client socket.io-client
```

### 3. Setting up the Feathers client.
To set up `atshop-service-models`, you'll first need to get your API client up and running.
```typescript
import Feathers from '@feathersjs/feathers';
import FeathersIO from '@feathersjs/socketio-client';
import SockeIO from 'socket.io-client';

const SocketClient = FeathersIO(SockeIO('https://api.atshop.io'));
const FeathersClient = Feathers();

FeathersClient.configure(SocketClient);
```

### 4. Setting up `atshop-service-models`
```typescript
import ConfigureModels from 'atshop-service-models/config';

ConfigureModels({
    app: FeathersClient,
});
```

**Setup complete!**

## Shops

### Fetch a shop by domain or ID.
```typescript
import { ShopModel } from 'atshop-service-models';

// Fetch a shop by subdomain: (e.g. test-shop.atshop.io)
let Shop = await ShopModel.find({ domain: 'test-shop' }).fetchOne();

// Fetch a shop by custom domain: (e.g. example.com)
Shop = await ShopModel.find({ customDomain: 'example.com' });

// Fetch a shop by ID
Shop = await ShopModel.get('ZBAWZE4LzB4RoguGY');
```

### Fetch a shop's products.  
```typescript
const products = await Shop.products.fetch(); // Returns an instance of PaginatedServiceModel.

products.data.forEach((product) => {
    console.log(product.name);          // Product name.
    console.log(product.description);   // Product description markdown.
    console.log(product.minQuantity);   // Minimum order quantity for the product.
    console.log(product.stockCount);    // Remaining stock.
    console.log(product.value);         // Dinero.js instance of the product price.
                                        // https://sarahdayan.github.io/dinero.js/
});
```

### Fetch a shop's categories
```typescript
const categories = await Shop.categories.fetch();

categories.data.forEach((category) => {
    console.log(category.title);    // Category heading
    console.log(category.slug);     // Category slug
    console.log(category.position); // Position of category relative to other categories.
});
```

## Orders

### Get an order by ID
```typescript
import { OrderModel } from 'atshop-service-models';

const order = await OrderModel.get('orderIdHere');

console.log(await order.product);       // Product ordered. 
console.log(await order.humanValue());  // Order value in a human format.
console.log(order.quantity);            // Quantity of product ordered.
console.log(order.description);         // Order description.
```

## Models
All `atshop-service-models` models come equipped with a set of reusable methods and properties that are used to 
interact with the API.

- `static App` Global Feathers.js application object `atshop-service-models`
- `static service` Feathers.js service object for the current model.
- `static create(data)` Create a new resource for the current model. Returns an instance of self.
- `static find(query)` Build a query for the current model. Returns an instance of `PaginatedServiceModel`.
- `static get(_id)` Fetch a single entry from the service by ID.
- `patch(data)` Merge the given data with the current model instance and send the changes to the API.
- `delete()` Delete the current model entry.

## Adding your own properties and methods
You can rather easily extend a model with your own functionality if you have any implementation specific needs.
```typescript
import { OrderModel as OrderServiceModel } from 'atshop-service-models';

class OrderModel extends OrderServiceModel {
    
    get emailer() {
        return new MyEmailerService({ defaultEmail: this.email });
    }
    
    sendThankYouEmail() {
        this.emailer.send({ message: 'Thank you for placing an order!' });
    }
    
}

// Send email.
OrderModel.get('someOrderId').then((order) => order.sendThankYouEmail());
```

To ensure your model is utilized for for future relationship calls. (e.g. `ShopModel.products`), you'll need to 
register it during the [configuration process](#4-setting-up-atshop-service-models).
```typescript
ConfigureModels({
    app: FeathersApp,
    models: {
        OrderModel: OrderModel, // Referencing the OrderModel you see up above.
    }
})
```
Now, any relationship that returns an OrderModel (e.g. `OrderFeedbackModel.order`) will be an instance of your custom
`OrderModel`.

### TypeScript users:
If you're a TypeScript user, you'll likely need to override the return types of model to model relationships. 
```typescript
class MyCustomProductModel extends ProductModel {
    
    // "Belongs to" and "has one" relationships return a promise.
    shop!: Promise<MyCustomShopModel> // Now you'll get proper type-hinting for any calls to the shop relationship on MyCustomProductModel.
    
}

class MyCustomShopModel extends ShopModel {
    
    // "Has many" relationships return instances of PagiantedServiceModel.
    products!: PaginatedServiceModel<MyCustomProductModel>
    
}
```

## Hooking into real-time events
If you're using the [Feathers Socket.io client](https://docs.feathersjs.com/api/client/socketio.html) as described in
the above setup instructions, you'll be able to listen for changes made to ATShop resources. This isn't strictly a 
feature of `atshop-service-models` as this functionality is provided directly by the [Feathers](https://feathersjs.com/)
instance you passed `atshop-service-models` during setup.

All model instances are equipped with a static `service` getter that returns a [Feathers Service](https://docs.feathersjs.com/api/services.html)
object specific to the model's associated service. This is where we derive the real-time functionality from in the 
below example.

```typescript
import { OrderModel } from 'atshop-service-models';

// Do note that you will receive events for all orders that are created for shops you have administrative permissions for.
OrderModel.service.on('created', async (orderData) => {
    const order = new OrderModel(orderData);
    const product = await order.product;
    const stock = await product.stockForSale.count();
    
    console.log(`An order was created by ${order.email}, you'll have ${stock - order.quantity} stock left after the order has been paid for.`)
})
```
