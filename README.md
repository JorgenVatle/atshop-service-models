# TypeScript Service Models for ATShop 2.0
A collection of models for interacting with the ATShop API. Easily **c**reate, **r**ead, **u**pdate and **d**elete 
ATShop resources.

## Installation & Setup
There's a couple steps to getting started with `atshop-service-models`.

### 1. Install
Just pull in the package through npm.
```bash
npm install atshop-service-models
```

### 2. Install dependencies.
Depending on where you're implementing these models, you'll also need to pull in and setup a 
[Feathers](https://feathersjs.com/) client.
```bash
npm install @feathersjs/feathers @feathersjs/socketio-client socket.io-client
```

### 3. Setting up the Feathers client.
To set up `atshop-service-models`, you'll first need to get your API client up and running.
```typescript
import Feathers from '@feathersjs/feathers';
import FeathersIO from '@feathersjs/socketio-client';
import SockeIO from 'socket.io-client';

const SocketClient = FeathersIO(SockeIO('https://api.atshop.io'));
const FeathersClient = Feathers();

FeathersClient.configure(SocketClient);
```

### 4. Setting up `atshop-service-models`
```typescript
import { SetupServiceModels } from 'atshop-service-models';

SetupServiceModels({
    app: FeathersClient,
});
```

**Setup complete!**

## Shops

### Fetch a shop by domain.
```typescript
import ShopModel from 'atshop-service-models/models/ShopModel'

const Shop = await ShopModel.find({ domain: 'test-shop' }).fetchOne();
```

### Fetch a shop's products.  
```typescript
const products = await Shop.products.fetch(); // Returns an instance of PaginatedServiceModel.

products.data.forEach((product) => {
    console.log(product.name);
});
```
